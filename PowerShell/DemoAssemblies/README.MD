#### Instructions
You should host this code on a webserver so that the PoC can pull them from somewhere.

A quick way to do this is with 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888' from the directory that they files are located in.  

You will need to update the URL in the powershell file to point to the URL you are using 'http://localhost:8888/' as an example.
